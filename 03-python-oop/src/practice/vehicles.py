"""
Define a Vehicle class with these instance attributes:
- name
- capacity

Also give it these class attributes
- max_capacity
- max_speed
- wheel_count

And these instance methods:
- add_riders(num)  # adds `num` number of riders to capacity (if they fit)
- get_fare()  # returns the fare for a single rider
- get_total_fares()  # returns the sum of fares for every rider
- honk()  # prints the sound the vehicle makes when it honks

Set up inheritance relationships for the rest of the classes and 
override any methods/attributes as required.
